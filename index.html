            <h3 id="writing">A pressure cooker can't pressure cook without steam. And while there are plenty of recipes that require the valve set at vent, your pressure cooking process is at risk if there isn't enough, well, pressure. Additionally, the steam valve can help prevent the liquid inside from evaporating and drying whatever you're cooking out. Always be sure to adjust the pressure valve to the appropriate setting before you start cooking</h3>
